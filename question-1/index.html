      Sample Q1: Create a web app which would take two inputs. It would also
      have 4 buttons: +, -, x /. Based on the button clicked perform the
      operation on the two inputs. You can do this in React or vanillaJS based
      on your choice. Your time starts now. See, you have 15 minutes to code
      this question. Questions are simple. We want to test whether: 1:You have
      done levelZero lectures properly. 2: You can form logic like this and come
      up with a program. All questions will be having one logic to implement it.
